<h1>Age confirmation on the Web is broken.</h1>
<p>To check the age of a user, many sites simply have the user input their age. However, the user could simply claim they are N years old and the website wouldn't know.</p>
<p>Another solution could be to require identifiable information, but then that necessitates security.</p>
<p>So I've come up with a simple fix to figure out the age of a user:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the link for the age you want to verify, let's say 18 years for this example. Ideally you do this the moment you are born.</li>
<li>Keep the page open in your browser for 18 years</li>
<li>After 18 years have passed, the page will show that you are verified as being at least 18 years old!</li>
<li>Then take a screenshot of the page and you can show it as proof of age for websites, bars, etc.</li>
</ol>
<a href="18.html">Verify that I'm 18 years old</a>
<a href="21.html">Verify that I'm 21 years old</a>
</body>
